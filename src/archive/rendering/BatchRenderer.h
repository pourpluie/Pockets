   BatchRenderer:

   Single-pass batch renderer.

   Each pass is a batch of RenderData components combined into a single
   triangle strip. The render passes are:
   1. Normal Pass
   - Geometry is drawn in layer order with premultiplied alpha blending
   2. Additive Pass
   - Geometry is drawn with additive blending (color += color.rgb)
   3. Multiply Pass
   - Geometry is drawn with multiply blending (color *= color.rgb)
   If a texture is assigned, it will be bound before rendering begins.
   The same texture will remain bound through all render passes.
   For "untextured" geometry, we leave a white pixel in the top-left corner
   of our sprite sheets and set all vertex tex coords to their default 0,0.
